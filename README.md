The TypeSpec MCP Server implements the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to enable you to quickly build out your own MCP servers powered by [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io/). We will also enable you to build REST APIs and other protocols supported by TypeSpec, though this is work in progress.

> Please note that this project is in Public Preview and implementation may significantly change prior to our General Availability.

## Overview

### What packages are in this repository?

Currently this repo contains the following packages:

- [mcp-server-typespec](https://github.com/bterlson/typespec-mcp/tree/main/packages/mcp-server-typespec) - an MCP server which assists in developing MCP extensions using TypeSpec.
- [typespec-mcp](https://github.com/bterlson/typespec-mcp/tree/main/packages/typespec-mcp) - a TypeSpec library for describing MCP servers, for example the `@tool` decorator.
- [typespec-mcp-server-js](https://github.com/bterlson/typespec-mcp/tree/main/packages/typespec-mcp-server-js) - A TypeSpec emitter that generates a server implementation in JavaScript for an MCP tool.
- [typespec-mcp-http-server-js](https://github.com/bterlson/typespec-mcp/tree/main/packages/typespec-mcp-http-server-js) - A TypeSpec emitter that generates a server implementation in JavaScript for calling a remote REST API.

## Currently Supported Tools

The TypeSpec MCP Server provides the following tools:

- `learnTypeSpec` - Initializes the model with information about how to understand and write TypeSpec.
- `init` - Scaffolds out a new project in the current working directory with example tool implementation.
- `compile` - Runs tsp compile to generate emitter assets
- `build` - Executes `npm run build` in the current project.

## Getting Started

The TypeSpec MCP Server requires Node.js to install and run the server. If you don't have it installed, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### VS Code + GitHub Copilot

The TypeSpec MCP Server provides assistance with authoring TypeSpec to generate MCP resource implementations. It can be used alone or with the [TypeSpec VS Code extension](https://typespec.io/docs/introduction/editor/vscode/) in VS Code.

### Prerequisites

1. Install either the stable or Insiders release of VS Code:
   - [Stable release](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   - [Insiders release](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)
2. Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 20 or later
   - Ensure `node` and `npm` are in your path
4. Open VS Code in an empty folder

Once you've installed the TypeSpec MCP Server, make sure you select GitHub Copilot Agent Mode and refresh the tools list. To learn more about Agent Mode, visit the [VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode).

#### Manual Install

For a step-by-step installation, follow these instructions:

1. Add `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "TypeSpec MCP Server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-typespec@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Test the TypeSpec MCP Server

1. Open GitHub Copilot in VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)
2. You should see the TypeCpec MCP Server in the list of tools
3. Try a prompt that tells the agent to use a TypeSpec MCP Server, such as "init" to scaffold a new project.
